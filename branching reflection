What is main? Main is where your complete work that has been reviewed by multiple people to check if it is correct is kept.

Why create a branch? You need to create a branch when working on a big project so that you are able to make changes an exact copy of the main, without messing up the final code. It also allows you to have your code reviewed before being implemented into the main code.
